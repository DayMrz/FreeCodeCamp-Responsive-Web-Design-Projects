                    React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and <strong>you can use as little or as much React</strong> as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started.
                </p>

                        If you&#96;re interested in playing around with React, you can use an online code playground. Try a Hello World template on <a class="blue-link" href="https://codepen.io/pen?&editors=0010">CodePen</a>, <a class="blue-link" href="https://codesandbox.io/s/new">CodeSandbox</a> or <a class="blue-link" href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-u7mesu">Stackblitz</a>.

                    <p>
                        You can <a class="blue-link" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html">add React to an HTML page in one minute</a>. You can then either gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a few dynamic widgets.

                    <p>
                        When starting a React project, a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html">simple HTML page with script tags</a> might still be the best option. It only takes a minute to set up!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As your application grows, you might want to consider a more integrated setup. There are several JavaScript toolchains we recommend for larger applications. Each of them can work with little to no configuration and lets you take full advantage of the rich React ecosystem. <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html">Learn how</a>.

                <p>
                    Like any unfamiliar technology, React does have a learning curve. With practice and some patience, you will get the hang of it.
                </p>

                <h4>First Examples</h4>
                <p>
                    The React homepage contains a few small React examples with a live editor. Even if you don&#96;t know anything about React yet, try changing their code and see how it affects the result.
                </p>
                <h4>React for Beginners</h4>
                <p>
                    If you feel that the React documentation goes at a faster pace than you&#96;re comfortable with, check out this overview of React by Tania Rascia. It introduces the most important React concepts in a detailed, beginner-friendly way. Once you&#96;re done, give the documentation another try!
                </p>
                <h4>React for Designers</h4>
                <p>
                    If you&#96;re coming from a design background, these resources are a great place to get started.
                </p>
                <h4>JavaScript Resources</h4>
                <p>
                    The React documentation assumes some familiarity with programming in the JavaScript language. You don&#96;t have to be an expert, but it&#96;s harder to learn both React and JavaScript at the same time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We recommend going through this JavaScript overview to check your knowledge level. It will take you between 30 minutes and an hour but you will feel more confident learning React.

                    React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    React has a few different kinds of components, but we&#96;ll start with <span class="yellow-highlight">React.Component</span> subclasses:
                </p>
                <pre class="code-container">
                    <code>
    class ShoppingList extends
        React.Component {
            render() {
                return ( 
                    &lt;div&gt;
                    className="shopping-list"&gt;
                        &lt;h1&gt;Shopping List for {this.props.name}&lt;/h1&gt;
                            &lt;ul&gt;
                                &lt;li&gt;Instagram&lt;/li&gt;
                                &lt;li&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/li&gt;
                                &lt;li&gt;Oculus&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;/ul&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                );
            }
        }
        &lt;!--// Example usage: &lt;ShoppingList
        name="Mark"/> -->
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    We&#96;ll get to the funny XML-like tags soon. We use components to tell React what we want to see on the screen. When our data changes, React will efficiently update and re-render our components.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here, ShoppingList is a <strong>React component class</strong>, or <strong>React component type</strong>. A component takes in parameters, called <span class="yellow-highlight">props</span> (short for “properties”), and returns a hierarchy of views to display via the <span class="yellow-highlight">render</span> method.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <span class="yellow-highlight">render</span> method returns a description of what you want to see on the screen. React takes the description and displays the result. In particular, <span class="yellow-highlight">render</span> returns a <strong>React element</strong>, which is a lightweight description of what to render. Most React developers use a special syntax called “JSX” which makes these structures easier to write. The &lt;div/&gt; syntax is transformed at build time to <span class="yellow-highlight">React.createElement('div')</span>. The example above is equivalent to:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
    return
    React.createElement('div',
    {classNAme: 'shopping-list'},
    React.createElement('h1',  /&#42;
    ...h1 children ...&#42;/),
    React.createElement('ul',  /&#42;
    ...ul children ...&#42;/),
    );
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    <a class="blue-link" href="https://babeljs.io/repl/#?browsers=defaults%2C%20not%20ie%2011%2C%20not%20ie_mob%2011&build=&builtIns=false&corejs=3.6&spec=false&loose=false&code_lz=DwEwlgbgBAxgNgQwM5IHIILYFMC8AiJACwHsAHUsAOwHMBaOMJAFzwD4AoKKYQgRlYDKJclWpQAMoyZQAZsQBOUAN6l5ZJADpKmLAF9gAej4cuwAK5wTXbg1YBJSswTV5mQ7c7XgtgOqEETEgAguTuYFamtgDyMBZmSGFWhhYchuAQrADc7EA&debug=false&forceAllTransforms=false&shippedProposals=false&circleciRepo=&evaluate=false&fileSize=false&timeTravel=false&sourceType=module&lineWrap=true&presets=react&prettier=false&targets=&version=7.16.9&externalPlugins=&assumptions=%7B%7D">See full expanded version.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <span class="yellow-highlight">ShoppingList</span> component above only renders built-in DOM components like 
                    <span class="yellow-highlight">&lt;div /></span> and <span class="yellow-highlight">&lt;li /></span>. But you can compose and render custom React components too. For example, we can now refer to the whole shopping list by writing <span class="yellow-highlight">&lt;ShoppingList /></span> . Each React component is encapsulated and can operate independently; this allows you to build complex UIs from simple components.
                </p>
                <h4 id="Inspecting-the-Starter-Code">Inspecting the Starter Code</h4>
                <p>
                    If you&#96;re going to work on the tutorial <strong>in your browser</strong>, open this code in a new tab: <strong><a class="blue-link" href="https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/oWWQNa?editors=0010">Starter Code</a></strong>. If you&#96;re going to work on the tutorial locally, instead open <span class="yellow-highlight">src/index.js</span> in your project folder (you have already touched this file during the <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#setup-option-2-local-development-environment">setup</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Starter Code is the base of what we&#96;re building. We&#96;ve provided the CSS styling so that you only need to focus on learning React and programming the tic-tac-toe game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By inspecting the code, you&#96;ll notice that we have three React components:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Square</li>
                    <li>Board</li>
                    <li>Game</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The Square component renders a single &lt;button> and the Board renders 9 squares. The Game component renders a board with placeholder values which we&#96;ll modify later. There are currently no interactive components.
                </p>
                <h4 id="Passing-Data-Through-Props">Passing Data Through Props</h4>
                <p>
                    To get our feet wet, let&#96;s try passing some data from our Board component to our Square component.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We strongly recommend typing code by hand as you&#96;re working through the tutorial and not using copy/paste. This will help you develop muscle memory and a stronger understanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Board&#96;s <span class="yellow-highlight">renderSquare</span> method, change the code to pass a prop called <span class="yellow-highlight">value</span> to the Square:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
    class Board extends
    React.Component {
        renderSquare(i) {
            return &lt;Square value={i} /&gt;
        }
    }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Change Square&#96;s <span class="yellow-highlight">render</span> method to show that value by replacing <span class="yellow-highlight">{/* TODO */}</span> with <span class="yellow-highlight">{this.props.value}</span>:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
    class Square extends
    React.component {
        render() {
            return (
                &lt;button
                className="square"&gt;
                {this.props.value}
                &lt;/button&gt;
            );
        }
    }
                    </code>
