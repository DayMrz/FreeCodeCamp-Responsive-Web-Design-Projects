                    React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and <strong>you can use as little or as much React</strong> as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><h4>Online Playgrounds</h4></li>
                    <p>
                        If you&#96;re interested in playing around with React, you can use an online code playground. Try a Hello World template on <a class="blue-link" href="https://codepen.io/pen?&editors=0010">CodePen</a>, <a class="blue-link" href="https://codesandbox.io/s/new">CodeSandbox</a> or <a class="blue-link" href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-u7mesu">Stackblitz</a>.
                    </p>
                    <li><h4>Add React to a Website</h4></li>
                    <p>
                        You can <a class="blue-link" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html">add React to an HTML page in one minute</a>. You can then either gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a few dynamic widgets.
                    </p>
                    <li><h4>Create a New React App</h4></li>
                    <p>
                        When starting a React project, a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html">simple HTML page with script tags</a> might still be the best option. It only takes a minute to set up!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As your application grows, you might want to consider a more integrated setup. There are several JavaScript toolchains we recommend for larger applications. Each of them can work with little to no configuration and lets you take full advantage of the rich React ecosystem. <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html">Learn how</a>.

                    People come to React from different backgrounds and with different learning styles. Whether you prefer a more theoretical or a practical approach, we hope you&#96;ll find this section helpful.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> If you prefer to <strong>learn by doing</strong>, start with our <a class="blue-link" href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">practical tutorial</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>If you prefer to <strong>learn concepts step by step</strong>, start with our <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html">guide to main concepts</a>.

                <p>
                    Like any unfamiliar technology, React does have a learning curve. With practice and some patience, you will get the hang of it.
                </p>

                <h4>First Examples</h4>
                <p>
                    The React homepage contains a few small React examples with a live editor. Even if you don&#96;t know anything about React yet, try changing their code and see how it affects the result.
                </p>
                <h4>React for Beginners</h4>
                <p>
                    If you feel that the React documentation goes at a faster pace than you&#96;re comfortable with, check out this overview of React by Tania Rascia. It introduces the most important React concepts in a detailed, beginner-friendly way. Once you&#96;re done, give the documentation another try!
                </p>
                <h4>React for Designers</h4>
                <p>
                    If you’re coming from a design background, these resources are a great place to get started.
                </p>
                <h4>JavaScript Resources</h4>
                <p>
                    The React documentation assumes some familiarity with programming in the JavaScript language. You don’t have to be an expert, but it’s harder to learn both React and JavaScript at the same time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We recommend going through this JavaScript overview to check your knowledge level. It will take you between 30 minutes and an hour but you will feel more confident learning React.
                </p>

                    The smallest React example looks like this:

                <p>
                    React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    React has a few different kinds of components, but we’ll start with <span class="yellow-highlight">React.Component</span> subclasses:
                </p>

                        class ShoppingList extends
                        React.Component {
                            render() {
                                return ( 
                                    &#60;div&#62;
                                    className="shopping-list"&#62;
                                        &#60;h1&#62;Shopping List for {this.props.name}&#60;&#47;h1&#62;
                                            &#60;ul&#62;

                            }
                        }

                    The React blog is the official source for the updates from the React team. Anything important, including release notes or deprecation notices, will be posted there first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also follow the @reactjs account on Twitter, but you won&#96;t miss anything essential if you only read the blog.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not every React release deserves its own blog post, but you can find a detailed changelog for every release in the CHANGELOG.md file in the React repository, as well as on the Releases page.
