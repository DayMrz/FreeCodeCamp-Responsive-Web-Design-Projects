                    React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and <strong>you can use as little or as much React</strong> as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started.

                    <p>
                        If youâ€™re interested in playing around with React, you can use an online code playground. Try a Hello World template on <a class="blue-link" href="https://codepen.io/pen?&editors=0010">CodePen</a>, <a class="blue-link" href="https://codesandbox.io/s/new">CodeSandbox</a> or <a class="blue-link" href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-u7mesu">Stackblitz</a>.

                    <li>Add React to a Website</li>
                    <p>
                        You can <a class="blue-link" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html">add React to an HTML page in one minute</a>. You can then either gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a few dynamic widgets.
                    </p>
                    <li>Create a New React App</li>
                    <p>
                        When starting a React project, a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html">simple HTML page with script tags</a> might still be the best option. It only takes a minute to set up!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As your application grows, you might want to consider a more integrated setup. There are several JavaScript toolchains we recommend for larger applications. Each of them can work with little to no configuration and lets you take full advantage of the rich React ecosystem. <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html">Learn how</a>.
